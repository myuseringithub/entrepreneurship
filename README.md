  Features: 
  Graph databases do not support subgraphs or multilayers, which will require a programmatic abstraction to implement over the database.
    - multi-layer views (Subgraphs) of a target unit/node. 
      - Changing representation of the graph according to the dimension model used with the target node. e.g. timescale dimension, where the target node is and entity and restricted to events relationship.
      - representing multiple units in relations to each other, or classified by one another. Diffenent algorithms to merge nodes into view: mutually inclusive, nested / included by one another, side by side, etc.
      - Cross relationships can be applied between the graph layers. 
    - Allowing to restrict to a target relationship types.
  Through which services could be built:
    - منصة لمشاركة الروابط عن أي كيان أو مفهوم. تسمح باستخدام الذكاء الاصطناعي بالاضافة لادخالات المستخدمين.
      - e.g. providing resources for projects, or articles.
    - Web presence graph
    - نَسِلْ Nasel: Family heritage 
  E.g. A person node graph can be represented in 2D/3D with relations to other persons or other entities, and relations to concepts. Using a layered model will allow for involving the reason/goal of the client/user into the search query. What is being searched and what for ? examples: a phrase for linguistic correctness, a name of entity for finding contact info or other info about it, a concept for understanding an abstract idea, a concept for classifying relative/related concepts, a phrase for finding news, a field for building a mind map, a place to look for location, a place positioned in timescale for historical insight, people for representing family tree relationships, entities for representing ownership through out time.
